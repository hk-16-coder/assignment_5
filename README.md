Task - 1:
I've first made a dictionary which acts as a database containing names and marks of  some students . 
Then the user enters a student's name.
Program searches the name as a key in dictionary , if key found returns marks of that student else displays 'student not found'.

This is a simple code using basic if-else and dictionay logic.
